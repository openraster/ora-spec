# Undo History

*Status*: proposal

*Author*: Efa

*Submission date*: 13 October, 2010

*Implementations*: none

OpenRaster file would be able to contain his undo history, like PSD do. This
would be useful to continue the editing session in next days or at a later
time, without loss anything.

Any program which does not support undo history OpenRaster files, would simply
show the last version of the raster and skip the undo commands history.
