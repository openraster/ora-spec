# Proposals and Application Specific Extensions

Those might move to the Extensions after discussion. Application developers are
invited to fork the repository and make pull requests. At some point it might be
proposed for inclusion to the Extensions through the Create mailing list.

Currently available proposals are:

* Effects Specification
* Palette
* Embed Fonts (Proposal to extension)
* Multiple pages
* Animation support using multiple pages and a timer like PSD do
* Undo-history support undo/history of commands/actions like PSD do
* PNG data requirements
