## OpenRaster Specification

Following agreement at the LGM2016 “Future of MyPaint” BOF,
minuted at http://pad.constantvzw.org/p/lgm2016.openraster.bof,
we agreed to move the specification from
its current home
at https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/OpenRaster/
to github.

The main goals are
to make the OpenRaster format more maintainable in the long term, and
to migrate old repos here
so that they can be maintained more visibly and publicly.

This repository will host
imported specification documents from the old wiki.
