# Extensions

This describes optional features that are not part of baseline. Extensions
should have published working code, and be supported in more than one
OpenRaster-aware application.

Currently available extensions are:

* Layer Selection Status — load and save layer selection state
* Layer Edit Locking Status — load & save layer immutability state
